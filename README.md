# FreddoBot
FreddoBot is a bot to inform you just how terrible the economy is. At 30 pence a pop, freddos are now *outrageously* expensive, do cadbury think I'm made of money?!

FreddoBot takes your local currency and tells you just how many Freddos you can buy with it, as well as how many you could have bought at their initial price

Use £convert [value] [currency] to find this out. Currency defaults to USD if none provided

Use £currentrates to list all availible currencies and the current exchange rate stored as compared to GBP. This is updated a maximum of once every 24 hours to not abuse the API. Thanks to https://exchangeratesapi.io for providing the exchange rates.
